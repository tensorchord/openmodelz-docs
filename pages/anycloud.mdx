# Deploy on Any Cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure, Lambda Labs, etc.)

It's super easy to deploy your models on any cloud. You could **start from a simple model, on a single machine, and scale it to a cluster of machines**.

## Create a VM and start the `mdz` server

After you have created a VM, you could download the `mdz` CLI with PyPI, and start the `mdz` server. You could provide the public IP to allow the `mdz` server to be accessible from the outside world.

```text {6}
$ pip install mdz
$ mdz server start <public ip>
...
🎉 You could set the environment variable to get started!

export MDZ_URL=http://1.2.3.4.modelz.live
```

## Deploy your model

You could deploy your model by using the `mdz deploy` command. We will deploy a stable diffusion web UI as an example.

```text
$ mdz --debug deploy --image modelzai/gradio-stable-diffusion:23.03 --gpu 1 --port 7860
$ mdz list
 NAME  ENDPOINT                                                 STATUS  INVOCATIONS  REPLICAS 
 llm   http://llm-qh2n0y28ybqc36oc.146.235.213.84.modelz.live   Ready           174  1/1      
       http://146.235.213.84.modelz.live/inference/llm.default                                
```

After the deployment is `Ready`, you could access the endpoint URL to access the web UI. It is `http://llm-qh2n0y28ybqc36oc.146.235.213.84.modelz.live` in this example.

## Scale your deployment

You could add more servers to support more traffic. First, you need to create a new VM on your cloud provider. Then, you could start the `mdz` server on the new VM and join it to the existing cluster.

```text
$ mdz server join <ip>
$ mdz server list
 NAME   PHASE  ALLOCATABLE      CAPACITY        
 node1  Ready  cpu: 16          cpu: 16         
               mem: 32784748Ki  mem: 32784748Ki 
 node2  Ready  cpu: 16          cpu: 16         
               mem: 32784748Ki  mem: 32784748Ki 
```

The IP address is the internal IP address of the previous VM. After the new VM is joined to the cluster, you could scale your deployment by using the `mdz scale` command.

```text
$ mdz scale llm --replicas 2
```

The requests will be load balanced between the replicas of your deployment. You already get a cluster of two machines to serve your model!
