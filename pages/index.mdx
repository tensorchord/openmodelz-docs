# OpenModelZ

Simplify machine learning deployment for any cloud (GCP, AWS, or others), your home lab, or even a single machine.

## Why use OpenModelZ

OpenModelZ is the ideal solution for practitioners who want to quickly deploy their machine learning models to a (public or private) endpoint without the hassle of spending excessive time, money, and effort to figure out the entire end-to-end process.

We created OpenModelZ in response to the difficulties of finding a simple, cost-effective way to get models into production fast. Traditional deployment methods can be complex and time-consuming, requiring significant effort and resources to get models up and running.

- Kubernetes: Setting up and maintaining Kubernetes and Kubeflow can be challenging due to their technical complexity. Data scientists spend significant time configuring and debugging infrastructure instead of focusing on model development.
- Managed services: Alternatively, using a managed service like AWS SageMaker can be expensive and inflexible, limiting the ability to customize deployment options.
- Virtual machines: As an alternative, setting up a cloud VM-based solution requires learning complex infrastructure concepts like load balancers, ingress controllers, and other components. This takes a lot of specialized knowledge and resources.

With OpenModelZ, we take care of the underlying technical details for you, and provide a simple and easy-to-use CLI to deploy your models to **any cloud (GCP, AWS, or others), your home lab, or even a single machine**.

You could **start from a single machine and scale it up to a cluster of machines** without any hassle. OpenModelZ lies at the heart of our [ModelZ](https://modelz.ai), which is a serverless inference platform. It's used in production to deploy models for our customers.

## Quick Start üöÄ

Once you've installed the `mdz` you can start deploying models and experimenting with them.

There are only two concepts in `mdz`:

- **Deployment**: A deployment is a running inference service. You could configure the number of replicas, the port, and the image, and some other parameters.
- **Server**: A server is a machine that could run the deployments. It could be a cloud VM, a PC, or even a Raspberry Pi. You could start from a single server and scale it up to a cluster of machines without any hassle.

### Bootstrap `mdz`

It's super easy to bootstrap the `mdz` server. You just need to find a server (could be a cloud VM, a home lab, or even a single machine) and run the `mdz server start` command. The `mdz` server will be bootstrapped on the server and you could start deploying your models.

```
$ mdz server start

üê≥ The server is running at http://192.168.71.93.modelz.live
üéâ You could set the environment variable to get started!

export MDZ_AGENT=http://192.168.71.93.modelz.live
```

The internal IP address will be used as the default endpoint of your deployments. You could provide the public IP address of your server to the `mdz server start` command to make it accessible from the outside world.

```bash
# Provide the public IP as an argument
$ mdz server start 1.2.3.4
```

### Create your first deployment

Once you've bootstrapped the `mdz` server, you can start deploying your first applications.

```
$ mdz deploy --image aikain/simplehttpserver:0.1 --name simple-server --port 80
Inference simple-server is created
$ mdz list
 NAME           ENDPOINT                                                          STATUS  INVOCATIONS  REPLICAS 
 simple-server  http://simple-server-4k2epq5lynxbaayn.192.168.71.93.modelz.live   Ready             2  1/1      
                http://192.168.71.93.modelz.live/inference/simple-server.default                                 
```

You could access the deployment by visiting the endpoint URL. It will be `http://simple-server-4k2epq5lynxbaayn.192.168.71.93.modelz.live` in this case. The endpoint could be accessed from the outside world as well if you've provided the public IP address of your server to the `mdz server start` command.

### Scale your deployment

You could scale your deployment by using the `mdz scale` command.

```bash
$ mdz scale simple-server --replicas 3
```

The requests will be load balanced between the replicas of your deployment.

### Debug your deployment

Sometimes you may want to debug your deployment. You could use the `mdz logs` command to get the logs of your deployment.

```bash
$ mdz logs simple-server
simple-server-6756dd67ff-4bf4g: 10.42.0.1 - - [27/Jul/2023 02:32:16] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
simple-server-6756dd67ff-4bf4g: 10.42.0.1 - - [27/Jul/2023 02:32:16] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
simple-server-6756dd67ff-4bf4g: 10.42.0.1 - - [27/Jul/2023 02:32:17] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

You could also use the `mdz exec` command to execute a command in the container of your deployment. You do not need to ssh into the server to do that.

```
$ mdz exec simple-server ps
PID   USER     TIME   COMMAND
    1 root       0:00 /usr/bin/dumb-init /bin/sh -c python3 -m http.server 80
    7 root       0:00 /bin/sh -c python3 -m http.server 80
    8 root       0:00 python3 -m http.server 80
    9 root       0:00 ps
$ mdz exec simple-server -ti bash
bash-4.4# uname -r
5.19.0-46-generic
bash-4.4# 
```

Or you could port-forward the deployment to your local machine and debug it locally.

```
$ mdz port-forward simple-server 7860
Forwarding inference simple-server to local port 7860
```

### Add more servers

You could add more servers to your cluster by using the `mdz server join` command. The `mdz` server will be bootstrapped on the server and join the cluster automatically.

```
$ mdz server list
 NAME   PHASE  ALLOCATABLE      CAPACITY        
 node1  Ready  cpu: 16          cpu: 16         
               mem: 32784748Ki  mem: 32784748Ki 
 node2  Ready  cpu: 16          cpu: 16         
               mem: 32784748Ki  mem: 32784748Ki 
```

### Label your servers

You could label your servers to deploy your models to specific servers. For example, you could label your servers with `gpu=true` and deploy your models to servers with GPUs.

```
$ mdz server label node3 gpu=true type=nvidia-a100
$ mdz deploy --image aikain/simplehttpserver:0.1 --name simple-server --port 80 --node-labels gpu=true,type=nvidia-a100
```
