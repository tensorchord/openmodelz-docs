# Start the First Server

A server is a machine that could run the deployments. It could be a cloud VM, a PC, or even a Raspberry Pi. You could start from a single server and scale it up to a cluster of machines without any hassle.

This page will show you how to start the first server.

## Hardware prerequisites

Hardware requirements scale based on the size of your deployments. Minimum recommendations are outlined here.

- 2 vCPUs
- 4 GB RAM

## GPU support

This requires the Nvidia Driver to be installed on the host machine before you run `mdz server start`. Check out the [Nvidia Driver Downloads](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) for more information.

If you are using the GPU VM from cloud providers (e.g. AWS, GCP, Lambda Labs and so on), the driver should be installed already. **Thus you don't need to install anything.**

For OS before Ubuntu 22.04, you might need to run the following command to make sure the GPU operator is working properly.

```bash
sysctl -w fs.inotify.max_user_watches=100000 
sysctl -w fs.inotify.max_user_instances=100000
```

If you're using Debian, you might need to add a symlink before you run `mdz server start`:

```bash
ln -s /sbin/ldconfig /sbin/ldconfig.real
```

## Start the server on Linux

You could get the help message of the `mdz server start` command by running `mdz server start -h`.

```
$ mdz server start -h
Start the server with the public IP of the machine. If not provided, the internal IP will be used automatically.

Usage:
  mdz server start [flags]

Examples:
  mdz server start
  mdz server start -v
  mdz server start 1.2.3.4

Flags:
  -g, --force-gpu   Start the server with GPU support (ignore the GPU detection)
  -h, --help        help for start

Global Flags:
      --debug                       Enable debug logging
  -u, --url string                  URL to use for the server (MDZ_URL) (default http://localhost:80)
  -v, --verbose                     Verbose output
```

You could start the server by running `mdz server start`. The internal IP address will be used as the default endpoint of your deployments. 

You could provide the public IP address of your server to the `mdz server start` command to make it accessible from the outside world.

<Callout emoji="💡">
  We will require the root permission to bootstrap the `mdz` server in port 80.

```bash
# Provide the public IP as an argument
$ mdz server start 1.2.3.4
$ mdz server start

🐳 The server is running at http://1.2.3.4.modelz.live
🎉 You could set the environment variable to get started!

export MDZ_URL=http://1.2.3.4.modelz.live
```

You could also specify the registry mirror to speed up the image pulling process. Here is an example:

```bash /--mirror-endpoints/
$ mdz server start --mirror-endpoints https://docker.mirrors.sjtug.sjtu.edu.cn
```

## Start the server on macOS or Windows

You need to create a linux VM first, with multipass for example.

```text {3}
$ multipass launch
$ multipass shell
$ mdz server start
```

Please notice that [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/) and other Rosetta emulation-based solutions on macOS are not supported.

## Check the status of the server

You could check the status of the server by running `mdz server list`.

```text /server list/
$ mdz server list
 NAME   PHASE  ALLOCATABLE      CAPACITY        
 node1  Ready  cpu: 16          cpu: 16         
               mem: 32784748Ki  mem: 32784748Ki 
```

## Label your servers

You could label your servers to deploy your models to specific servers. For example, you could label your servers with `gpu=true` and deploy your models to servers with GPUs.

```text /gpu=true,type=nvidia-a100/
$ mdz server label node1 gpu=true type=nvidia-a100
$ mdz deploy --image aikain/simplehttpserver:0.1 --name simple-server --port 80 --node-labels gpu=true,type=nvidia-a100
```

If you have different type of GPUs, you can label your nodes with `mdz server label node3 gpu=true type=nvidia-a100` and deploy the serevice to the selected nodes with `mdz deploy --image llama2 --node-labels gpu=true,type=nvidia-a100`.
