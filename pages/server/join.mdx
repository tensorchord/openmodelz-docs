# Add More Servers

You could join a new server to the cluster by running `mdz server join` on the new server if you want to add more servers to your cluster.

You could provide the internal IP address of the first server to the `mdz server join` command.

```
$ mdz server join <internal-ip-of-the-first-server>
$ mdz server list
 NAME   PHASE  ALLOCATABLE      CAPACITY        
 node1  Ready  cpu: 16          cpu: 16         
               mem: 32784748Ki  mem: 32784748Ki 
 node2  Ready  cpu: 16          cpu: 16         
               mem: 32784748Ki  mem: 32784748Ki 
```

There're two types of nodes in the `mdz` cluster, `controller` and `worker`. 
- The controller will manage the whole cluster and expose the service endpoint.
- The workers will run the deployments and can be added or removed dynamically.

By default the `controller` machine will also be a `worker` machine, thus one machine can form a single node cluster. `mdz server start` will bootstrap a controller and worker. `mdz server join` will only bootstrap a worker and join it to the pre-existing cluster.
