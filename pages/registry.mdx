# OpenModelZ Registry

OpenModelZ registry is a a free, open-source Image registry for public machine learning models that makes it easy to deploy with [OpenModelZ](https://github.com/tensorchord/openmodelz) and other orchestration tools, e.g. Docker.

We provide the images out of the box. You could add more models to this registry by creating a pull request. Please follow the [contribution guide](./registry/add-your-model) to add more models.

Or you could [raise an issue](https://github.com/tensorchord/openmodelz/issues/new) to request a model to be added to this registry.
