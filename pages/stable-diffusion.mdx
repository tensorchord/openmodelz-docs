# Stable Diffusion Web UI

It's super easy to deploy stable diffusion web UI with `mdz`. You just first start the `mdz` server:

```bash
$ mdz server start
# If your server has the public IP address, you could specify it as an argument:
$ mdz server start 1.2.3.4
```

Then you could deploy the stable diffusion web UI with the following command:

```text
$ mdz deploy --image modelzai/gradio-stable-diffusion:23.03 --name sdw --port 7860 --gpu 1
Inference sd is created
$ mdz list
 NAME  ENDPOINT                                                 STATUS  INVOCATIONS  REPLICAS 
 sdw   http://sdw-qh2n0y28ybqc36oc.146.235.213.84.modelz.live   Ready           174  1/1      
       http://146.235.213.84.modelz.live/inference/sdw.default                                
```

You could access the stable diffusion web UI by visiting the endpoint URL. The endpoint will be automatically generated for each deployment with the following format: `<name>-<random-string>.<ip>.modelz.live`.

It is `http://sdw-qh2n0y28ybqc36oc.146.235.213.84.modelz.live` in this case. The endpoint could be accessed from the outside world as well if you've provided the public IP address of your server to the `mdz server start` command.
