# Create the First Deployment

## Install `mdz`

You can install OpenModelZ using the following command:

```text copy
pip install openmodelz
```

You could verify the installation by running the following command:

```text copy
mdz
```

Once you've installed the `mdz` you can start deploying models and experimenting with them. There are only two concepts in `mdz`:

- **Deployment**: A deployment is a running inference service. You could configure the number of replicas, the port, and the image, and some other parameters.
- **Server**: A server is a machine that could run the deployments. It could be a cloud VM, a PC, or even a Raspberry Pi. You could start from a single server and scale it up to a cluster of machines without any hassle.

You could deploy a model by running `mdz deploy --image <image>`. The deployment will be accessible from the outside world by default.

```
$ mdz deploy --image aikain/simplehttpserver:0.1 --name simple-server --port 80
Inference simple-server is created
$ mdz list
 NAME           ENDPOINT                                                          STATUS  INVOCATIONS  REPLICAS 
 simple-server  http://simple-server-4k2epq5lynxbaayn.192.168.71.93.modelz.live   Ready             2  1/1      
                http://192.168.71.93.modelz.live/inference/simple-server.default                                 
```

You could access the deployment by visiting the endpoint URL. It will be `http://simple-server-4k2epq5lynxbaayn.192.168.71.93.modelz.live` in this case. The endpoint could be accessed from the outside world as well if you've provided the public IP address of your server to the `mdz server start` command.

If your service requires GPUs, you can add the `--gpu 1` flag to indicate how many GPUs you need. The deployment will be scheduled to a GPU node.

```text /--gpu 1/
$ mdz deploy --image aikain/simplehttpserver:0.1 --name simple-server --port 80 --gpu 1
Inference simple-server is created
```

Please checkout the [server](/server/start) page for more information about the `mdz server` command and GPU support.

## Scale your deployment

You could scale your deployment by using the `mdz scale` command.

```bash
$ mdz scale simple-server --replicas 3
```

The requests will be load balanced between the replicas of your deployment.

## Debug your deployment

Sometimes you may want to debug your deployment. You could use the `mdz logs` command to get the logs of your deployment.

```bash
$ mdz logs simple-server
simple-server-6756dd67ff-4bf4g: 10.42.0.1 - - [27/Jul/2023 02:32:16] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
simple-server-6756dd67ff-4bf4g: 10.42.0.1 - - [27/Jul/2023 02:32:16] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
simple-server-6756dd67ff-4bf4g: 10.42.0.1 - - [27/Jul/2023 02:32:17] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

You could also use the `mdz exec` command to execute a command in the container of your deployment. You do not need to ssh into the server to do that.

```
$ mdz exec simple-server ps
PID   USER     TIME   COMMAND
    1 root       0:00 /usr/bin/dumb-init /bin/sh -c python3 -m http.server 80
    7 root       0:00 /bin/sh -c python3 -m http.server 80
    8 root       0:00 python3 -m http.server 80
    9 root       0:00 ps
$ mdz exec simple-server -ti bash
bash-4.4# uname -r
5.19.0-46-generic
bash-4.4# 
```

Or you could port-forward the deployment to your local machine and debug it locally.

```
$ mdz port-forward simple-server 7860
Forwarding inference simple-server to local port 7860
```
