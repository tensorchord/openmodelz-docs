# Add Your Model

## Add your model to the registry

You could add your model to the registry by creating a pull request. Please follow the steps below:

1. Fork this [documentation repository](https://github.com/tensorchord/openmodelz-docs)
2. Create a new markdown file under [`pages/registry`](https://github.com/tensorchord/openmodelz-docs/tree/main/pages/registry) folder. The file name should be the same as your model name. For example, if your model name is `my-model`, then the file name should be `my-model.mdx`.
3. Copy the following template to your markdown file and fill in the details:

    ```markdown

4. Add one new bullet point to the [`registry.mdx`](https://github.com/tensorchord/openmodelz-docs/blob/main/pages/registry.mdx) file under `pages` folder. The bullet point should be the same as your model name. For example, if your model name is `my-model`, then the bullet point should be `- [My Model](./registry/my-model) - My Model Description`
